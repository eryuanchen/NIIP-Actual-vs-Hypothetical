# NIIP: Actual vs Hypothetical
This is a Matlab version project (other versions to be continued). 

# Data 
3 data sets required: Net International Investment Position (NIIP), Current Acount Balance (CA) and Gross Domestic Production (GDP) at the same frequency. 
## Definition
1. Net International Investment Position (NIIP): difference between foreign asset position (A) and foreign liability position (L).
2. Current Account Balance (CA): Based on International Transaction Accounts (ITA), consists of trade balance, income balance and net unilateral transfers.
3. Gross Domestic Production (GDP): Market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period by a country (wiki).
## Trick
All you need to do is to find a data base, like CEIC, World Bank Database etc. BE CAREFUL TO YOUR DATA!
 
# Demo
In the demo, I use annual timeseries data of China from CEIC, 2004 to 2023 (Observation = 19).
